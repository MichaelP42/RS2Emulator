# RS2Emulator
RS2Emulator is a project that emulations different revisions of RS2.

<h2>Revisions</h2>
RS2Emulator aims to emulate many different revisions of RuneScape 2. I've decided to start with an older revision and build up to higher revisions. With this being said, RS2Emulator will begin with the #443 revision. The #443 revision was between December 15, 2006 and December 19, 2006.
